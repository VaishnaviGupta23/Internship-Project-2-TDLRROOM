-Designed and implemented “Running room management system” website for Indian Railways for Tundla Running Rooms
in Prayagraj Division for North Central Railways during my internship as a Web Developer at Rungta software solutions, Prayagraj

Starting with the basics, I gained proficiency in core web development
languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and PHP. I learned how
to create and style web pages, add interactivity, and ensure crossbrowser
compatibility.
• Then using this knowledge I further started the coding part of the
website using PHP.
• I used WAMP framework which is
Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP framework for this project.
• Also used VertrigoServ ,which is a WAMP server, for the PHP
development

For the frontend part of the project, I used HTML, CSS and Javascript
using which , I designed the whole website and added functionalities.
• For the backend part, I solely used PHP which is one of the most used
language for building scalable and dynamic websites.
• For the use integration of a database for storing the data in the backend
part of my project , I used MySQL. I used phpMyAdmin, which is a tool
for the management of MySQL.
